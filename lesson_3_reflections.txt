When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  When you want to share the code OR when you want get a code from some other server/laptop.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	It is just an extra layer of safety. Also, someone else might do the changes and you might not like and so probably its better to pull manually.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	
	Forks are clones but in GitHub alone and not in local machine. Clones can be a copy in GitHub or local machine. Branches exist only in one repository.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

	So when you are using push and pull you will come to know the conflict before hand.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

	You update your changes in Git and push your changes in GitHub. Then you can ask for pull requests from the other user which is essentially asking whether the changes can be merged to master branch. Its quite complicated.
